# Notes on damage calculation

Damage = - (Attack^2) / (Attack + Defense)

For example:
Attack 112 vs Defense 5.05 => -(112*112)/(112+5.05)=-12544/117.05=-107.1679 => damage -107.17

In the game the unit health is visualized like two separate bars -- one is the unit basic health, another is the unit additional health (due to bonus from hero characteristics). The health points of units are calculated manually and added to the reports, the calculations might contain inaccuracies or incorrectness. But the unit characteristics health data is accurate.

# Notes on army layouts

Army is formed into kind of square -- into lines with some amount of units in the line.
For example, army of 36 units will be formed into 6 lines by 6 units. 25 units - into 5 lines by 5 units. 30 units - into 5 lines by 6 units. 20 units - into 4 lines by 5 units.
Itermediate army layout (e.g. for 33 units) -- is matter of learning from reports or guessing/extrapolating. Layouts are determined -- knowning total amount of units you can unambiguously predict the layout (lines amount and how many units in each line).

All that information about layout is preliminary info -- attack reports might provide more precise insights. So the following description about layout are just some ideas to understand better the attack reports.

SisterOfMercy - those units tend to appear starting from last lines (lines with bigger number) by one unit in each line from the last line to the line #2 (but not to the first line -- they are not in the front). If those units filled all the lines from latest to #2 and if there are still some units to layout -- then they appear as a second unit in the last line, then as a second unit in the next line from last, etc.

Sage - those units tend to concentrate in last lines. Probably by one or two units starting from the last line.

Crossbowman -- those units also tend to concentrate in last lines, but at least one unit is appearing at line #2.

Horseman - those units tend to go into first lines and to appear in every place where aforementioned units were not placed.

Hero - usually appears in the first line, gut closer to the last units in the line.

    - Unit #D1.2: Dragon (1320+100) health
- Line #2:
    - Unit #D2.1: Dragon (1320+100) health

Events:
1. Dragon #D1.1 attacks horseman #A1.1. Attack 112 vs Defense 5.05 => damage -107.17. Probably #A1.1 health is now (225+101.25)-107.17=219.08
2. Dragon #D1.2 attacks horseman #A1.1. Attack 112 vs Defense 5.05 => damage -107.17. Probably #A1.1 health is now 219.08-107.17=111.91
3. Dragon #D2.1 attacks horseman #A1.1. Attack 112 vs Defense 5.05 => damage -107.17. Probably #A1.1 health is now 111.91-107.17=4.74
4. Hero #A1.5 attacks dragon #D1.1. Attack 82.40 vs Defense 140 => damage -30.53. Probably #D1.1 health is now (1320+100)-30.53=(1320+69.47)
5. SisterOfMercy #A2.2 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now 4.74+16.80=21.54
6. Crossbowman #A2.6 attacks dragon #D1.1. Attack (18*1.46) vs Defense 140 => damage -4.13. Probably #D1.1 health is now (1320+69.47)-4.13=(1320+65.34)
7. SisterOfMercy #A3.2 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now 21.54+16.80=38.34
8. SisterOfMercy #A3.5 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now 38.34+16.80=55.14
9. SisterOfMercy #A4.3 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now 55.14+16.80=71.94
10. SisterOfMercy #A4.5 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now 71.94+16.80=88.74

Notes:
- Horsemen didn't do any attack on dragons because horsemen cannot attack aerial units.
- SisterOfMercy units in lines #5 and #6 didn't do any healing because their heling range is 3, but the damaged horseman unit is in line #1 -- the line #1 is 4 lines far from the line #5, but range is lower. If range would be 4, then sisters from line #5 would manage to heal horseman in line #1.
- Crossbowman units in lines #5 and #6 didn't do any attack on dragons, because their damage range is 4. Line #5 is 5 lines far from dragons, range is lower.
- Sages didn't do any attack on dragons, because their damage range is 3, but they are located in lines #4, #5, #6 -- so they are located too far, range is lower.
- Looks like 35 units lead to layout: Line#1x6units, Line#2x6units, Line#3x6units, Line#4x5units, Line#5x6units, Line#6x6units.

11. SisterOfMercy #A4.5 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now (225+44.48)+16.80=(225+61.28)
12. SisterOfMercy #A5.3 heals horseman #A2.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A2.1 health is now 128.71+16.80=145.51
13. SisterOfMercy #A5.6 heals horseman #A2.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A2.1 health is now 145.51+16.80=162.31

Notes:
- Dragon #D2.1 attacked horseman #A1.1 instead of #A2.1 because the dragons damage range is 2, but the dragon #D2.1 is in line #2 of defense and horseman #A2.1 is in line #2 of attack. It is like that: AttackLine#2(Horseman#A2.1) AttackLine#1 DefenseLine#1 DefenseLine#2(Dragon#D2.1) -- so the dragon is 3 lines far from the horseman; so that the dragon's range is too low for #A2.1 horseman.

## Round 8

Layout same like in Round 1 because no change in armies units count, but of course health is altered.

Events:
1. Hero #A1.5 regenerates. Health +27.0. Probably #A1.5 health is now 648.51+27.0=675.51
2. Dragon #D1.1 attacks SisterOfMercy #A2.2. Attack 69.07 vs Defense 4.04 => damage -65.25. Probably #A2.2 health is now (45+20.25)-65.25=0
3. Dragon #D1.1 attacks horseman #A2.3. Attack 42.93 vs Defense 5.05 => damage -38.41. Probably #A2.3 health is now (225+101.25)-38.41=(225+62.84)
4. Dragon #D1.2 attacks horseman #A2.3. Attack 112 vs Defense 5.05 => damage -107.17. Probably #A2.3 health is now (225+62.84)-107.17=180.67
5. Dragon #D2.1 attacks horseman #A1.2. Attack 112 vs Defense 5.05 => damage -107.17. Probably #A1.2 health is now 120.04-107.17=12.87
6. Hero #A1.5 attacks dragon #D1.1. Attack 82.40 vs Defense 140 => damage -30.53. Probably #D1.1 health is now 1193.90-30.53=1163.37
7. SisterOfMercy #A2.2 heals horseman #A2.3. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A2.3 health is now 180.67+16.80=197.47
8. Crossbowman #A2.6 attacks dragon #D1.2. Attack (18*1.46) vs Defense 140 => damage -4.13. Probably #D1.2 health is now (1320+91.74)-4.13=(1320+87.61)
9. SisterOfMercy #A3.2 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now (225+61.28)+16.80=(225+78.08)
10. SisterOfMercy #A3.5 heals horseman #A1.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.1 health is now (225+78.08)+16.80=(225+94.88)
11. SisterOfMercy #A4.3 heals horseman #A1.1. (5.69*1.12) => healing +6.37. Probably #A1.1 health is now (225+94.88)+6.37=(225+101.25)
12. SisterOfMercy #A4.3 heals horseman #A1.2. (9.31*1.12) => healing +10.43. Probably #A1.2 health is now 12.87+10.43=23.30
13. SisterOfMercy #A4.5 heals horseman #A1.2. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A1.2 health is now 23.30+16.80=40.10
14. SisterOfMercy #A5.3 heals horseman #A2.3. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A2.3 health is now 197.47+16.80=214.27
15. SisterOfMercy #A5.6 heals horseman #A2.1. (15*1.12) => healing +16.80. Probably #A2.1 health is now 162.31+16.80=179.11

Notes:
- Now SisterOfMercy #A2.2 - eliminated! -- this unit was first SisterOfMercy who usually healed the latest damaged unit (but I'm not sure if it is a strict rule or if I understand that correctly). This unit managed to heal even being eliminated.
- Probably (I'm not sure)  SisterOfMercy #A5.3 healed horseman #A2.3 instead of #A2.1 because of SisterOfMercy #A2.2 elimination. But it might be not correct (probably need more such cases for analysis)

## Round 9

1 unit was eliminated from the previous round, so that now the army layout is changed (now it is 34 units in the attacker army):

>>> Further rounds report doesn't contain info about health points or events, but still contain layout and info on losses.

## Round 14,15,16,17

Layout same like in Round 13 because no change in armies units count, but of course health is altered.

## Round 18

Layout same like in Round 13 because no change in armies units count, but of course health is altered.
